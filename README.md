## Software Engineer | Systems & Security Enthusiast

I am a **Computer Science graduate** with a strong foundation in core computing principles and a practical approach to problem-solving. My interests lie in understanding how software systems operate in real-world environments, particularly at the intersection of **systems, networking, and security**.

I focus on building, analyzing, and improving technical solutions through hands-on experimentation. My work reflects a curiosity-driven mindset, attention to detail, and an emphasis on writing structured, maintainable code that behaves reliably under realistic constraints.

## Technical Focus Areas

My experience spans multiple domains of computer science, with particular emphasis on:

- **Systems & Application Security**  
  Understanding common software weaknesses, secure design principles, and defensive mechanisms across applications and services.

- **Networking & Distributed Systems**  
  Exploring how data moves through networks, how systems communicate, and how reliability and security are maintained at scale.

- **Automation & Tooling**  
  Designing small, purpose-built tools to simplify analysis, testing, and system inspection tasks.

- **Software Analysis & Reliability**  
  Debugging, monitoring, and evaluating system behavior to improve correctness, stability, and performance.

## Approach to Engineering

I value:
- Clear problem decomposition  
- Readable, well-structured code  
- Learning through implementation rather than abstraction alone  

I continuously refine my understanding of computer systems by experimenting with different technologies, architectures, and security models.

## Professional Outlook

I am actively exploring opportunities where I can:
- Contribute to technically rigorous teams  
- Work close to core systems and infrastructure  
- Continue developing depth in software engineering and security-related roles
