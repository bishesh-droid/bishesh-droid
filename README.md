## Civil Engineering Graduate | Cybersecurity & Systems Enthusiast  
**BITS Pilani**

I am a **Civil Engineering graduate from BITS Pilani** with a strong interest in **cybersecurity and software systems**. During my academic journey, I developed a growing inclination toward computing and system-level problem solving, which led me to actively pursue cybersecurity as my primary technical focus.

My background in engineering has shaped a structured and analytical approach to problem-solving, which I now apply to understanding how software systems, networks, and infrastructure behave in real-world environments. I focus on learning through hands-on implementation, experimentation, and continuous refinement of technical fundamentals.

## Areas of Technical Interest

My interests broadly span across core computing and security domains, including:

- **Application & Systems Security**  
  Understanding common security weaknesses, secure design principles, and defensive strategies across modern software systems.

- **Networking & Infrastructure**  
  Exploring how systems communicate, how data flows across networks, and how reliability and security are maintained at scale.

- **Automation & Tooling**  
  Building focused tools and scripts to assist with analysis, testing, and system inspection.

- **Software Behavior & Reliability**  
  Observing, debugging, and analyzing system behavior to improve correctness, stability, and resilience.

## Engineering Mindset

I value:
- Clear reasoning and structured problem breakdown  
- Readable, maintainable, and purposeful code  
- Practical learning grounded in implementation rather than theory alone  

My work reflects a steady transition from a core engineering background into software and security-focused problem spaces.

## Career Focus

I am actively seeking opportunities where I can:
- Apply my engineering foundation to cybersecurity and system-level roles  
- Work in technically rigorous environments  
- Continue developing depth in security, systems, and software engineering
