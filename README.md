# Cybersecurity Engineer & Developer

I am a dedicated and results-oriented cybersecurity professional with a proven ability to design, develop, and implement robust security solutions. My passion lies in the continuous pursuit of knowledge and the application of cutting-edge technology to solve complex security challenges. I possess a comprehensive understanding of various cybersecurity domains, demonstrated through the successful completion of over 150 projects spanning from foundational concepts to advanced, specialized areas.

## Core Competencies

My expertise is built on a strong foundation of both theoretical knowledge and practical application. I am proficient in the following areas:

### 🛡️ Offensive & Defensive Security
- **Web Application Security:** In-depth knowledge of the OWASP Top 10, with hands-on experience in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), and Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR). I have also developed custom Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) and Content Security Policy (CSP) generators.
- **Network Security:** Expertise in network traffic analysis, intrusion detection and prevention (IDS/IPS), and the implementation of security measures like honeypots, firewalls, and VPNs. I have built custom packet sniffers and network traffic visualizers to identify and analyze malicious activity.
- **Malware Analysis & Reverse Engineering:** Proficient in both static and dynamic malware analysis techniques. I have experience with reverse engineering tools like Ghidra and IDA Pro, and I have developed my own malware analysis sandboxes and Yara rule generators. My projects also include the creation of simulated ransomware for educational purposes.

### 🔐 Cryptography & Data Security
- **Applied Cryptography:** Solid understanding of cryptographic principles and experience in implementing symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms such as AES and RSA. I have built file encryption/decryption tools and digital signature implementation projects.
- **Data Privacy:** I have explored and implemented privacy-enhancing technologies, including projects on steganography and simple homomorphic encryption.

### ☁️ Cloud & Infrastructure Security
- **Cloud Security:** Hands-on experience with major cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure). I have developed tools to scan for common misconfigurations, analyze IAM policies for excessive permissions, and audit cloud storage for public access.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security:** I have worked on projects to scan and secure IaC templates from tools like CloudFormation and Terraform.

### ⚙️ Specialized Domains
- **IoT & Embedded Systems Security:** I have experience in scanning for and identifying IoT devices, extracting and analyzing firmware, and testing the security of IoT protocols like MQTT, BLE, and Zigbee.
- **Digital Forensics:** Proficient in memory forensics, log file correlation, and the analysis of file systems and browser history to investigate security incidents.
